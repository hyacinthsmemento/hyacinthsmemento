I go by Eli (He/Him) and you can most often find me in my Tokyo Revengers ponies.

Feel free to sit with me but ask if you want to cuddle/want my socials.

If you see "Semi AFK" or "AFK" in my pony name, you can get my attention by booping me a ton (I have a big monitor so I might not notice whispers or messages right away if I'm not looking at my screen)

My Pony List: Akane, Hanma (Tenjiku), Izana, Kazutora (Valhalla), Draken (Casual wear), Kisaki (Tenjiku), Kokonoi (Black Dragon, Tenjiku, Bonten), Mikey (Toman), Ran (Casual wear, Tenjiku, Bonten), Rindo (Casual wear, Tenjiku, Bonten), Sanzu (Toman, Bonten), Seishu (Black Dragon), Souya (Twin Devils), Wakasa (Brahman).

Ask if you want me to swap to anyone for photos.
